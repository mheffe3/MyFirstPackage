\examples{arithSeq(1,0,5)
Returns a vector containg a sequence of 5 terms with a common difference of 1 and an inital term of 0
(0 1 2 3 4)
##---- Should be DIRECTLY executable !! ----
##-- ==>  Define data, use random,
##--	or do  help(data=index)  for the standard data sets.

## The function is currently defined as
arithSeq <- function(d,a1,n)
{
  count <- 0
  sequence <- vector()
  while(count < n)
  {
    sequence <- append(sequence, (a1 + (count)*d))
    count <- count+1
  }

  return(sequence)

}

% Add one or more standard keywords, see file 'KEYWORDS' in the
% R documentation directory (show via RShowDoc("KEYWORDS")):
% \keyword{ ~kwd1 }
% \keyword{ ~kwd2 }
% Use only one keyword per line.
% For non-standard keywords, use \concept instead of \keyword:
% \concept{ ~cpt1 }
% \concept{ ~cpt2 }
% Use only one concept per line.
